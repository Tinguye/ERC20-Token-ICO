# ERC20-Token-ICO
A simple ERC20 token and ICO contract

This smart contract in Solidity is for an ERC20 token and ICO

We followed the ERC20 token standard to build a new cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. We implemented the functions as defined in the standard, and then sent our new token around to fellow students. We tracked our transactions on the Rinkeby Ethereum network and learnt about block explorers and different wallets that can be used to interact with the blockchain. We discussed the utility and value of tokens.  We then added a few lines of code to our token contracts which turns it into an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which is basically a mechanism to sell a token after creation to raise funds.
